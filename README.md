# Distributed Machine Learning Study Group

The purpose of this group is to work through the Deep Learning book written by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville and express the concepts described using the Julia programming language.

The goal is to form a more fundamental understanding of the material in the Deep Learning book (aided by deeplearning.ai whenever necessary) of how key pieces that make up deep and representation learning are implemented. We form this understanding by implementing things from first principles where appropriate or examining existing Julia packages where a great one exists.

Julia excels at numerical computations and borrows enough of PLT to be interesting, and I believe is a worthwhile language to know some basics of.

The meetings will be mostly online over Hangouts, but sometimes at Optfit's WeWork offices at WeWork Lab in Denver.
